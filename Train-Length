'''A train running at the speed of 60 km/hr crosses a pole in 9 seconds. What is the length of the train'''
input  : speed,time
output : meters

speed=60
speed1=60*5/18
time=9
print(f'Units Must be same in speed {speed} km/hr and time is in {time}seconds so change the speed of train in meter/sec = {speed*5/18}')
print(f'The Length of Train ={speed1*time}meters')
